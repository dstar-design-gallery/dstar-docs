# Features and Interactions

D.Star's key features (e.g., one object - many views, two object types (collections and alternatives), large displays) make its user interface different from many other applications. 

## The D.Star Menu

D.Star is designed for large displays in which you choose where to
work on the display. Its menu thus floats: it is available wherever
your current focus lies. `Right-click` to access the main menu.

<!--- a comment --->

The main menu provides six categories. Some categories are single commands.
