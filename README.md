# Get Started

Clone `designgallery-docs` from the repository.

```bash
git clone https://csil-git1.cs.surrey.sfu.ca/derisen/designgallery-docs
```

You will need [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) to run the docs. It is recommended to install `docsify-cli` globally, which helps initializing and previewing the website locally.

!> **important**: make sure that `node` and `npm` are [installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

```bash
npm i docsify-cli -g
```

Run the local server with `docsify serve`. You can preview your site in your browser on `http://localhost:3000`

```bash
docsify serve designgallery-docs
```
